# Old School Runescape bots built using Dreambot client APIs.
To run any of these bots, please make sure you have the latest version of the [Dreambot](https://dreambot.org/) client running.
If you're new to RS Botting or have any suggestions, feel free to tweet me [@pashmerepat](https://twitter.com/pashmerepat)
Some of you asked to add pre-compiled versions that you can directly run in Dreambot, you can find them all in the [/ExportedScripts](https://github.com/pashpashpash/RunescapeBots/tree/master/ExportedScripts) folder.
