# Old School Runescape bots built using Dreambot client APIs.
To run any of these bots, please make sure you have the latest version of the [Dreambot](https://dreambot.org/) client running.
If you're new to RS Botting or have any suggestions, feel free to tweet me [@pashmerepat](https://twitter.com/pashmerepat)
Some of you asked to add pre-compiled versions that you can directly run in Dreambot, you can find them all in the [/ExportedScripts](https://github.com/pashpashpash/RunescapeBots/tree/master/ExportedScripts) folder.

WARNING : After exploit-test-botting for 24 hours straight, I got banned while using the YewCutting script. Use at your own risk.

## [CookingAndWoodcutting](https://github.com/pashpashpash/RunescapeBots/tree/master/src/CookingAndWoodcuttingBot) Bot
Alternating activities every 20ish minutes is a good call to avoid ban detection. This script cooks for 20 Min, then cuts wood for 20 min, then breaks on Lumbridge Bridge for 4 minutes before log out. All with anti-ban. Recommend taking a 20-60 minute break before running script again.
